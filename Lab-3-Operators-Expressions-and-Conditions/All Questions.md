Programming 1: Lab 3 : Operators, Expressions and Conditions
Write the python code for the following questions. Handle all the valid and invalid test cases. Write
down relevant comments in your code:
1. If the lengths of the two parallel sides of a trapezoid are X meters and Y meters, respectively,
and the height is H meters, what is the area of the trapezoid? Write Python code to output the
area by taking X, Y and H as input from the user.
2. Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person’s weight and height. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fat
for most people. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but research has shown that BMI
correlates to direct measures of body fat, such as underwater weighing and dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry. The formula for BMI is weight/height2 where weight is in kilograms and height
is in meters.
1. Write a program that prompts for metric weight and height and outputs the BMI.
2. Write a program that prompts for weight in pounds and height in inches, converts the
values to metric, and then calculates the BMI.
3. Take 3 numbers as input, and find whether they form the sides of a triangle or not. Consider
invalid cases also.
4. Take a 3 digit number as input and find the sum of its digits. Also, check if the sum is divisible by
3 or not.
5. Take a 5 digit number as input and print the reverse of the number. Do not use any in-built
functions for reversing. Check whether the input number and the reversed number are the
same. If so, print “Number is Palindrome”, else print “Number is not Palindrome”.
6. Swap the values of two integer variables without using a third variable or multiple assignment
operation.
7. Input two complex numbers and find their sum, and multiplication.
8. Calculate the gross salary of an employee by taking as input the basic Salary.
HRA = 20% of basic salary, TA is 5% of basic salary, and DA is 10% of basic salary.
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + TA + DA
9. Further, in the above question, find the income tax slab in which the employee lies.
Gross Salary Income Tax
< Rs. 3 LPA 0%
Rs. 3,00,000 – Rs. 10,00,000 10% of the gross salary
Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 25,00,000 20% of the gross salary
Above Rs. 25,00,000 30% of the gross salary
10. Find the largest of 3 numbers using nested if else condition.
11. Take a 3 digit number as input. Check if it is an Armstrong number or not. E.g. 13 + 53 + 33 = 153
