4. Represent 2D matrix of dimensions M x N, by taking M, N and matrix elements as input from the
user. Perform following operations on these 2D matrices.
1. Add 2 matrices. Display the values in the input matrices as well as the summation matrix.
2. Multiply 2 matrices. Note that the input matrices need to be checked for compatible
multiplication, i.e., 2 matrices with M x N and N x P dimensions can be multiplied, if number
of columns in 1st matrix is equal to the number of rows in the 2nd matrix. Consider all the
valid and invalid test cases and display the results.
